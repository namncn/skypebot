SkypeBot
========
Some day I'll create something useful, using PHP-DBUS bindings.
This one is only proof-of-concept code, and it works.

Description
-----------
This "project" uses Skype-DBUS API, which is deprecated. Yet it can be still used
in version 4.X of Skype, which is latest available on Linux OS.

Requirements
------------
* php-dbus extension: http://pecl.php.net/package/DBus
